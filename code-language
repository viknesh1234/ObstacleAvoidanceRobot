### 1. C++ (Primary Language)
   - The entire code is written in C++ syntax.
   - Used for defining logic, functions, and hardware control via libraries.

### 2. Arduino Framework
   - A subset of C++ specific to Arduino, including built-in functions like pinMode(), digitalWrite(), and Serial.print().
   - Provides hardware abstraction for sensors, motors, and other peripherals.

### 3. Libraries
     - Servo Library (<Servo.h>)
     - Used to control the servo motor for scanning.
     - Adafruit Motor Shield Library (<AFMotor.h>)
     - Manages DC motor controls through the Adafruit motor shield.
   
### 4. Serial Communication Protocol
   - The Serial functions provide a means to send and receive data over a serial connection.
   - This is a protocol rather than a language but is critical for Bluetooth and voice control functionalities.

### 5. Embedded System Programming
   - This involves directly interfacing with hardware (e.g., ultrasonic sensor) and controlling timing (delay(), pulseIn()).
   - Part of embedded C/C++ principles.
